# INTRODUCTION
This is an optional case study from the Google Data Analytics Course that I recently completed. In this study, I put into practice the Data study Process that I learnt while taking the course by executing real-world responsibilities as a junior data analyst for a fictitious company called Cyclistic.


## SCENARIO
In this mock data analysis, I'm assuming the role as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
